## Overview

This helper returns options dictionary used to configure ESBuild.
The following configurations are set:

  * Enable JS minification.
  * Enable source map if not building for production.
  * Prepare `process.env.<ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE>` defines based on enabled features.
    This allows ESBuild to optimize JS bundle size by removing code related 
    to unused features.
  * Added `process-shim.js` so `process.env` is defined. 
    This way we don't have to explicitly specify every environment 
    variable via `defines` value.
  * Prepare `params` for feature and service configs used in JS.

## Detailed Concepts

### `feature` and `service`

Features configured in site wide `config.yml` file under `params.features` section.
A **feature** provides a certain functionality to the user via one or more services.
A feature be can enabled or disabled.

A **service** is a 3rd party service, or JS library that implements a feature.

For example, `analytics` is considered a feature. 
There are many services that can provide this feature, to name a few:
  
  * Google Analytics
  * Counter.Dev
  * GoatCounter

To maximize extendibility and therefore usefulness as an open source project, 
it is important to define a standard interface that is easy to understand, 
configure, and extend.

In this file, I took the liberty of standardizing this interface under `params.features`.
Please note that this breaks compatibility with previous versions of `config.yaml`.
I will provide sample `config.yaml` files with fully documented features, as well as
documentation on migrating the `config.yaml` file to the new standard.

Here is a sample config file for the new `params.features` section. Notice that each `service`
is a dictionary with `enable` and `services` key. `services` is a dictionary with each key
corresponding to a concrete service, and value as configuration / settings. In the case of
services that need no configuration, an empty dictionary is created.

```yml
params:
  features:

    # This is the `analytics` feature
    analytics:
      # This feature is enabled      
      enable: true
      # List of services to enable    
      services:

        # Google Analytics is enabled
        google:
          # settings for Google Analytics   
          id: G-xxxxx
        
        # # Counter Dev is disabled
        # counterDev:   
        #  id: foo
        #  name: bar
    
    # The `darkMode` feature
    darkmode:
      enable: true
      services:
        # darkmode is realized by using DarkReader library
        darkreader:
          # options are 'system', 'dark', 'light'
          defaultColorScheme: system
          # For all available options, see `interface DynamicThemeFix`:
          #   https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader/blob/main/index.d.ts#L125
          fixes:
            invert: ['img[src$=".svg"]'] # inverts svg colors.
          # For all available options, see `interface Theme` in:
          #   https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader/blob/main/index.d.ts#L45
          theme:
            brightness: 100
            contrast: 100
            sepia: 0
```

This helper will convert the above config into the following env vars:

  * `FEATURE_ANALYTICS=1`
  * `FEATURE_ANALYTICS_GOOGLE=1`
  * `FEATURE_DARKMODE=1`
  * `FEATURE_DARKMODE_DARKREADER=1`

In JS, you can use it like this:

```js
import * as params from '@params';

if (process.env.FEATURE_ANALYTICS) {
  // Do things to enable this feature here

  if (process.env.FEATURE_ANALYTICS_GOOGLE) {
    // Do things things to enable google analytics
  }
}
```

You can also access service configs via params:

```js
import * as params from '@params';

console.log(params);
```

You will see console output like below. Note, each service configuration is
namespaced by their corresponding feature.

```json
{
  "analytics": {
    "google": {
      "id": "G-xxxxx"
    }
  },
  "darkmode": {
    "darkreader": {
      "defaultColorScheme": "system",
      "fixes": {
        "invert": "['img[src$=\".svg\"]']"
      },
      "theme": {
        "brightness": 100,
        "contrast": 100,
        "sepia": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```
