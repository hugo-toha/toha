## Requirements

- Hugo Version 0.68.0 or higher

## Usage

In order to use this theme, follow the following steps:

#### Add theme as git submodule

At first, add [Toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) theme as git submodule to your hugo-site.

```console
$ git submodule add https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha.git themes/toha
```

> Don't use SSH URL of the theme during adding as git sub-module. Also, don't clone the theme in your `themes` directory using `git clone`. They don't work well with Github Action or Netlify.

If you don't already have a hugo site, create one by following the step-by-step guide from [here](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/getting-started/prepare-site/).

#### Configuring Site

Now, configure your site to use `toha` theme by adding the following configuration in `config.yaml` file of your site.

```yaml
baseURL: https://hugo-toha.github.io

languageCode: en-us
title: "John's Blog"
theme: "toha"

# Manage languages
# For any more details, you can check the official documentation: https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/
languages:
  en:
    languageName: English
    weight: 1

# Control TOC depth
markup:
  tableOfContents:
    startLevel: 2
    endLevel: 6
    ordered: false

# At least HTML and JSON are required for the main HTML content and
# client-side JavaScript search
outputs:
  home:
  - HTML
  - RSS
  - JSON

# Enable global emoji support
enableEmoji: true

# Site parameters
params:
  # GitHub repo URL and branch of your site
  gitRepo: https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io
  gitBranch: main

  # specify whether you want to write some blog posts or not
  enableBlogPost: true

  # specify whether you want to show Table of Contents in reading page
  enableTOC: true

  # Provide newsletter configuration. 
  # This feature has been implemented for Mailchimp only for now.
  # You can also hide it from the footer.
  newsletter:
    # specify whether you want to display the newsletter form 
    enable: true
    # specify which newsletter provider you want to use
    provider: mailchimp
    # specify the target URL for the subscription form
    mailchimpURL: https://github.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=19de52a4603135aae97163fd8&amp;id=094a24c76e
```

Don't forget to update `title`, `baseURL`, and `gitRepo` fields with your own information. To know about more available configuration options, please visit [here](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/configuration/site-parameters/).

#### Running Locally

Now, you can run your hugo site with `toha` theme locally with the following command:

```console
$ hugo server --theme toha --watch
```

When you run your site for first time, it will start with the default parameters. It should look similar to the [example site](https://hugo-toha.github.io). However, it will not have any sections in the homepage as we haven't configured them yet. You can configure your site by following the guides from [here](https://toha-guides.netlify.app/posts/configuration/).

> I am not a web developer. I have created this theme for my personal needs. So, it is reasonable to have some flaws in the codes. Feel free to open issues and PRs acknowledging the problems.

## Local Development

For local development, you can make changes in the theme submodule and test the changes against your own site or this [example site](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io) locally.

### Fork

At first, fork [this repo](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha). Then, follow the following steps to use the forked theme for local developments,

**Using the forked theme in your own site:**

If you want to run your local development against your own site, follow the following steps:

```bash
# add the original theme as a submodule of your site if you haven't done already
$ git submodule add https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha.git themes/toha
# navigate into the toha theme folder
$ cd themes/toha
# add your own fork as a remote
$ git remote add my-fork https://github.com/<your-github-user>/toha
# create a new branch for your changes
$ git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

**Using the forked theme in the example site:**

If your want to run your local development against this [example site](https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io), follow the following steps:

```bash
# clone the example site along with the submodules
$ git clone git@github.com:hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io.git --recursive
# navigate into the toha theme folder
$ cd themes/toha
# add your own fork as a remote
$ git remote add my-fork https://github.com/<your-github-user>/toha
# create a new branch for your changes
$ git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

From there you can make changes to the source code of the theme while testing with your running Hugo site or the example site.

### Open a PR

When the changes look good, commit and push them to your fork.

```bash
# stage all the changes
$ git add .
# commit the changes with a meaning full commit message
$ git commit -m "A meaningful commit message"
# push the commit to your fork
$ git push my-fork my-feature-branch
```

Then, open a PR against `main` branch of [hugo-toha/toha](https://github.com/hugo-toha/toha) from the `my-feature-branch` branch of your own fork.
